The purpose of this web app is to be able to read an image reference from 
a Firebase DB, and using the reference, find the corrisponding image in
the Firebase Storage. Once the image is found, it takes the URL of the image
and displays it on the webpage.  

If you decide to connect your own Firebase, you will need to change the 
credentials in "app.js" 

Here's a list of the files and their purpose:
    - index.php: Dynamically lays out the webpage for easy expansion 
                 and deployment with Heroku using the PHP buildpack
    - header.html: Contains the head, title, and css link all pages need
    - landing.html: Contains the content of the page 
    - footer.html: Contains the links to the Firebase Libraries, JQuery, 
                   and the local Javascript files
    - style.css: Styling for the webpage
    - app.js: Connects the app to the Firebase and carries out a set of 
              instructions such as retreiving the image reference, and searching the Storage
              for it to then get and display the image through a URL link.
